# Secure RESTful API with Spring Boot Assignment

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to create a secure RESTful API using Spring Boot. The API should implement authentication and authorization mechanisms using Spring Security and interact with a database using Spring Data JPA.

## Project Setup
1. **Create a new Spring Boot project using your preferred IDE.**
2. **Configure the project to use Spring Boot, Maven, and an H2 database.**

## Entity and Repository Setup
1. **Define an entity class (e.g., User) with attributes like id, username, password, and other relevant fields.**
2. **Create a Spring Data JPA repository for the entity.**

## REST API Implementation
1. **Implement RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on the User entity.**
2. **Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and URL mappings.**
3. **Ensure that the API follows RESTful conventions.**

## Spring Security Configuration
1. **Configure Spring Security to enable basic authentication.**
2. **Implement a custom UserDetailsService to load user data from the database.**

## Integration Testing
1. **Write integration tests for the REST API endpoints using tools like MockMvc.**
2. **Test both authenticated and unauthenticated access to different endpoints.**
3. **Ensure proper handling of different HTTP status codes.**

## Role-Based Access Control
1. **Extend the security configuration to include role-based access control.**
2. **Define roles (e.g., ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN) and associate them with users.**
3. **Restrict certain endpoints based on user roles.**

## Exception Handling
1. **Implement custom exception handling to provide meaningful error responses for various scenarios.**
2. **Handle exceptions like ResourceNotFoundException, AccessDeniedException, etc.**
